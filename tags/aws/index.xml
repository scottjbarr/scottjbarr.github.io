      <title>Moving SQS Messages To Another Queue</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently we ran into a situation at work where we needed to move all
messages from one of our dead letter queues, back onto the &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo;
queue for the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS doesn&amp;rsquo;t expose a way to move messages out of the box, so I wrote a
small utility, which I creatively
named &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scottjbarr/sqsmv&#34;&gt;sqsmv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the project in &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; because it is a great
fit for command line programs, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked with
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go&#34;&gt;Go AWS SDK&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a bunch of messages and tested it&amp;hellip; First try! This is
something I find happens more often when I&amp;rsquo;m building with Go,
compared to doing the same task with a dynamic language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scottjbarr/sqsmv&#34;&gt;sqsmv&lt;/a&gt; has worked well,
successfully moving hundreds of messages between SQS queues. I hope
someone out there finds it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Processing Sidekiq jobs with Go Workers</title>
      <link>/2016/08/30/go-workers-sidekiq/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I have a personal project where a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq&#34;&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/a&gt; worker (written in Ruby)
was using between 150-200MB of RAM with 20 workers. These workers take
images that have been uploaded to a Rails application, and upload them
to an Amazon S3 bucket in the background. Most of the time these
workers are idle. This project generates exactly $0.00 income, and I&amp;rsquo;m
paying for that RAM, which even in the amazing days of cloud
computing, is still too expensive to waste on a personal budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to replace the Ruby process with a Go process in an attempt
to reduce this wasted, idle RAM. (Sadly I do this kind of thing a
lot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace the Ruby process, I needed to write some Go code that could
upload files to Amazon S3, and process Sidekiq jobs from a Redis
queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code that does the upload was really easy to write using the
official &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go&#34;&gt;AWS Go SDK&lt;/a&gt; library. I
wrote nothing more than a little wrapper really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then added an application that picks up Sidekiq jobs from
Redis. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult as the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cupcake/gokiq&#34;&gt;Gokiq&lt;/a&gt; library does most of the
heavy lifting here. Working out a nice way to unpack the job data into
my Worker struct without modifying the Gokiq library took some
thought, but came out OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;end-result&#34;&gt;End Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Go process uses 28MB of RAM with 200 workers available. Compared
to the 150-200MB of RAM with 20 workers that I had before, this is a
nice little win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scottjbarr/s3uploader&#34;&gt;s3uploader&lt;/a&gt; repository on
Github if is sounds useful.&lt;/p&gt;
