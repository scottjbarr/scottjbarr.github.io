        Processing Sidekiq jobs with Go Workers
      </a>

<p>I have a personal project where a
<a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a> worker (written in Ruby)
was using between 150-200MB of RAM with 20 workers. These workers take
images that have been uploaded to a Rails application, and upload them
to an Amazon S3 bucket in the background. Most of the time these
workers are idle. This project generates exactly $0.00 income, and I&rsquo;m
paying for that RAM, which even in the amazing days of cloud
computing, is still too expensive to waste on a personal budget.</p>

<p>I decided to replace the Ruby process with a Go process in an attempt
to reduce this wasted, idle RAM. (Sadly I do this kind of thing a
lot).</p>

<p>To replace the Ruby process, I needed to write some Go code that could
upload files to Amazon S3, and process Sidekiq jobs from a Redis
queue.</p>

<p>The code that does the upload was really easy to write using the
official <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go">AWS Go SDK</a> library. I
wrote nothing more than a little wrapper really.</p>

<p>I then added an application that picks up Sidekiq jobs from
Redis. This wasn&rsquo;t too difficult as the
<a href="https://github.com/cupcake/gokiq">Gokiq</a> library does most of the
heavy lifting here. Working out a nice way to unpack the job data into
my Worker struct without modifying the Gokiq library took some
thought, but came out OK.</p>

<h2 id="end-result">End Result</h2>

<p>The Go process uses 28MB of RAM with 200 workers available. Compared
to the 150-200MB of RAM with 20 workers that I had before, this is a
nice little win.</p>

<p>Take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/scottjbarr/s3uploader">s3uploader</a> repository on
Github if is sounds useful.</p>

        Multiple Go Versions

    <p>Running multiple versions of Go is simple. I see and hear chatter
about it, and there are a few tools around to handle it for you, but
it is so simple to do yourself that I&rsquo;m surprised people reach for a
tool to do this for them.</p>

<p>Mostly I run the latest stable version of Go, but for whatever reason
(maybe I want to test out a release candidate), I do have multiple
versions installed, and I don&rsquo;t want multiple installations to clobber
each other.</p>

<p>The following assumes you&rsquo;re on some kind of *nix system, and you&rsquo;re
using Bash. Other OS&rsquo;es and shells will be able to work as well with
appropriate changes.</p>

<p>I like to keep my Go installations under <code>~/.go/versions</code>. You can
choose any location you like though.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.go/versions
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s grab the latest version of Go (currently 1.6). I&rsquo;m downloading
the OS X archive here, but if you&rsquo;re running another OS you would
download the appropriate archive. Take a look at the Go
<a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Downloads</a> page.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.go/versions
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxf go1.6.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
mv go go1.6
rm go1.6.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Add the following environment variables to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>.</p>

<pre><code>export GOPATH=~/p/go
export GOROOT=~/.go/versions/go1.6
export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>This is where I set my default version of Go.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : <code>GOPATH</code> is where your Go projects will live, and <code>GOROOT</code>
is where the Go installation lives. Don&rsquo;t confuse the two.</p>

<p>Start a new shell and you should have <code>go</code> on your path.</p>

<pre><code>$ go version
go version go1.6 darwin/amd64
</code></pre>

<p>Success!</p>

<p>So for whatever reason I also want an older version of Go installed.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.go/versions
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.5.3.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxf go1.5.3.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
mv go go1.5.3
</code></pre>

<p>Too easy. You must be getting bored.</p>

<p>Now I can temporarily switch to the another version by exporting the
desired <code>GOROOT</code> and prefixing my current <code>$PATH</code> with <code>$GOROOT/bin</code>. In this case I am switching to the freshly installed GO 1.5.3.</p>

<pre><code>$ export GOROOT=~/.go/versions/go1.5.3
$ export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
$ go version
go version go1.5.3 darwin/amd64
</code></pre>

    <p>I&rsquo;m a software developer, but I often describe myself as a Digital
Plumber. From time to time I&rsquo;m also a Data Scientist.</p>

<p>I build systems in Go (my favourite language), Ruby, and Python. I&rsquo;m
always working with HTML5 and Javascript, and I&rsquo;ve even built a few
native apps. I am fortunate enough to spend my working days building
cool systems with a bunch of smart people.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always keen to partner on great ideas. Talk to me.</p>

<p>Yes, I can and haved worked with &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; :)</p>

<p>You can reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/scottjbarr">Twitter</a> or take
a look at some of my projects on
<a href="https://github.com/scottjbarr">Github</a>.</p>
