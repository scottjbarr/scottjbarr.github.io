I'm a software developer. I really like writing systems in Go (a.k.a Golang),
Ruby and Python. I'm always working with HTML5 and Javascript, and I've even
built a few native apps.

I'm the founder of the
[Brisbane Gophers](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Golang-Meetup/), where
people interested in Go get together and share what they're learned with each
other.

I often describe myself as a Digital Plumber, but I also play as a
Data Scientist from time to time.

I'm always keen to partner on great ideas. Talk to me. I don't bite.

Yes, I can and haved worked with "the cloud" :)

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottjbarr) or take a look
at some of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/scottjbarr).
