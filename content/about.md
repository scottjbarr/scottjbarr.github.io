I'm a software developer.

I really like writing software in Go, and I am fortunate enough to
spend quite a bit of time doing so, with a bunch of smart people.

I often describe myself as a Digital Plumber, but I also play as a
Data Scientist from time to time.

I love building systems in Go, Ruby, and Python. I'm always working
with HTML5 and Javascript, and have even built a few native apps.

I'm always keen to partner on great ideas. Talk to me.

Yes, I can and haved worked with "the cloud" :)
