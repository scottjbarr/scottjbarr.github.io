I'm a software developer.

I often describe myself as a Digital Plumber, but I also play as a
Data Scientist from time to time.

I love building systems in Go, Ruby, and Python. I'm always working
with HTML5 and Javascript, and have even built a few native apps.

I'm always keen to partner on great ideas. Talk to me.

Yes, I can and haved worked with "the cloud" :) *(Believe it or not, that is still a question that gets asked)*

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottjbarr) or take a look at
some of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/scottjbarr).
